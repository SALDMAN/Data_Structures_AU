# 📚 Data Structures - Ariel University

This repository contains content, assignments, and code examples from the **Data Structures** course at the **Computer Science Faculty, Ariel University** (Semester B, 2026).

## 📖 Course Overview
This is a mandatory fundamental course for the B.Sc. in Computer Science. It serves as a prerequisite for advanced courses such as **Algorithms** and **Object-Oriented Design**.

The course focuses on three main pillars:

### 1. Complexity Analysis ⏱️
* Calculating Time Complexity ($O(n)$, $O(\log n)$, etc.)
* Analyzing Space Complexity.
* Understanding Recursion and the Master Theorem.

### 2. Sorting and Searching Algorithms 🔍
* Implementation of sorting algorithms (Merge Sort, Quick Sort, etc.).
* Binary Search vs. Linear Search.

### 3. Data Structures Implementation 🏗️
Deep dive into the logic and implementation of:
* **Linear:** Stacks, Queues, Linked Lists.
* **Trees:** Binary Search Trees (BST), AVL Trees, Red-Black Trees, B-Trees.
* **Other:** Heaps, Hash Tables, Union-Find.
